**cco** (Claude Container, or Claude Condom if you're so inclined) provides essential protection while Claude Code is up close and personal with your system. It automatically selects the best available sandboxing method - using native OS sandboxing (sandbox-exec on macOS, bubblewrap on Linux) when available, or falling back to Docker as a barrier to keep Claude contained while keeping your real system safe.

## Why protection matters

Running Claude Code with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` feels great - fast, responsive, no interruptions. But going in unprotected has risks: web search makes Claude vulnerable to prompt injections that could trick it into accessing files outside your project or running unexpected commands.

**`cco` lets you have it both ways: all the pleasure of autonomous Claude, with a barrier between Claude and your machine's sensitive areas.**

### The problem with exposure
- **Leaves Claude Unprotected**: Lightning fast but vulnerable to nasty prompt injections
- **Mood killer**: Constant permission prompts kill the flow

### Protected interaction
- **Smooth operation**: No more constant permission prompts
- **Barrier protection**: Keeps unwanted side effects contained
- **Peace of mind**: Enjoy the experience without worry
- **Easy cleanup**: Fresh environment every time

For more information about `cco`'s security model, limitations, and threat analysis, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Quick start

### Installation
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sfdan/cco/master/install.sh | bash
```

### Usage
Just type `cco` where you would normally type `claude` and your protection is on!

```bash
cco "write a hello world script"
cco "help me refactor this code"
```

## Design philosophy

**`cco` gets out of your way.** It's designed to feel natural - like using Claude directly, just safer.

- **Thin layer**: Barely noticeable protection
- **Natural feel**: Works exactly like `claude` but protected
- **No surprises**: Everything you expect, just contained
- **Seamless experience**: Your environment, your files, your workflow

You should barely notice `cco` is there, except for that reassuring feeling of safety.

## How it works

**`cco` runs Claude Code inside a sandboxed environment.** It automatically detects and uses the best available sandboxing method:

- **Native sandboxing (default when available)**: Uses OS-native tools (sandbox-exec on macOS, bubblewrap on Linux) for lightweight, fast isolation
- **Docker sandboxing (fallback)**: Uses Docker containers when native tools aren't available

- **Automatic sandbox selection**: Chooses native OS sandboxing when available, Docker as fallback
- **Native sandbox (preferred)**: Lightweight, fast startup, direct Keychain access on macOS
- **Docker sandbox (fallback)**: Full isolation with container filesystem when native tools unavailable
- **Host file access**: Your project files are accessible so Claude can read and edit them
- **Network access**: Full host network access for localhost development servers, MCP servers, and web requests
- **Credential management**: Authentication is handled securely without exposing host credentials
- **Enhanced features**: Background tasks enabled by default for improved code analysis and autonomous development (Docker mode)
- **Full toolchain**: Docker container includes development tools, languages, and utilities Claude needs

The result? Claude gets the `--dangerously-skip-permissions` experience it needs to be productive, while potential risks are contained within the sandbox.

## Why cco vs alternatives?

There are several alternatives for running Claude Code in containers:
- [Anthropic's official devcontainer spec](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/devcontainer) for VS Code
- [claudebox by RchGrav](https://github.com/RchGrav/claudebox) - a feature-rich container environment
- Basic Docker approaches

Here's why cco is the better choice for developers who want simplicity and seamless integration:

### Simplicity and workflow
- **One command**: `cco "help me code"` - that's it. Devcontainers require VS Code setup, configuration files, and "Reopen in Container"
- **No IDE dependency**: Works in any terminal, no VS Code required. Devcontainers are VS Code-specific
- **Instant startup**: Spins up immediately, no container rebuilding. Devcontainers rebuild on configuration changes
- **Zero configuration**: Install once, works everywhere. Devcontainers need devcontainer.json setup per project
- **Pass-through arguments**: All Claude Code options work normally (`--resume`, `--model`, etc.) without configuration

### First-class macOS support
- **Keychain integration**: Automatically extracts Claude Code credentials from macOS Keychain. Devcontainers require manual credential setup
- **User mapping**: Handles macOS UIDs (501) vs Linux container UIDs automatically. Devcontainers use generic container users
- **File permissions**: Perfect permission mapping between macOS host and Linux container without configuration
- **Platform detection**: Smart platform-specific logic. Devcontainers use one-size-fits-all approach

### Terminal responsiveness
- **Window resizing works properly**: When you resize your terminal, Claude's interface adapts in real-time (via SIGWINCH signal forwarding). Devcontainers don't handle this
- **Native terminal feel**: Interactive terminal interface works exactly like native Claude Code
- **Real-time interface updates**: Claude's TUI reflows and adapts when you resize your terminal window
- **Full signal support**: All terminal signals work properly, not just basic input/output

### Credential security
- **Zero credential baking**: Credentials never get built into Docker images, unlike some devcontainer setups
- **Runtime-only mounting**: Secure credential extraction and temporary mounting. Devcontainers often persist credentials in container
- **Cross-platform auth**: Works with macOS Keychain, Linux files, and environment variables automatically
- **No manual setup**: Finds and uses credentials without devcontainer configuration

### Development workflow integration  
- **Project-aware**: Container names based on directory, proper working directory handling. Devcontainers use generic naming
- **MCP server compatibility**: Host networking enables localhost MCP servers without configuration. Devcontainers may require network setup
- **Environment inheritance**: Terminal settings, Git config, locale automatically available. Devcontainers need explicit environment configuration
- **Smart caching**: Uses previous images as build cache for faster rebuilds without configuration

| **Philosophy**           | Invisible simplicity             | Feature-rich environment      | IDE integration           |

**Choose devcontainer if you:**
- Want VS Code integration and IDE features
- Need team collaboration and shared environments  
- Require sophisticated firewall rules and network restrictions

**Choose claudebox if you:**
- Want extensive development profiles (C++, Python, Rust, etc.)
- Need per-project Docker images and isolation
- Want comprehensive package management and firewall control
- Don't mind setup complexity for feature richness

**Choose cco if you:**
- Live in the terminal and want Claude Code to feel native
- Want the simplest possible secure Claude setup  
- Prefer zero configuration over feature customization
- Value instant startup and seamless macOS integration

`cco` isn't trying to be a development environment - it's trying to be invisible protection that lets you use Claude Code exactly as intended, just safely.

## Installation

### One-liner install
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sfdan/cco/master/install.sh | bash
```

### Manual setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sfdan/cco.git
cd cco
chmod +x cco
sudo ln -s "$PWD/cco" /usr/local/bin/cco && cp sandbox /usr/local/
```

## Usage

### Basic operation
```bash
# Interactive session
cco

# Direct commands  
cco "analyze this codebase"
cco --resume  # Claude Code option passed through

# Get help
cco --help
```

### Advanced options
```bash
# Force a specific sandbox backend
cco --backend native  # Use native sandbox (sandbox-exec/bubblewrap)
cco --backend docker  # Use Docker sandbox
cco --backend auto    # Auto-detect (default)

# Rebuild the protective layer (Docker mode only, also updates to latest Claude Code version)
cco --rebuild

# System information and status
cco --info

# Shell access for inspecting the container environment
cco shell
cco shell 'ls -la'  # Run shell commands inside the cco container

# Custom environment
cco --env API_KEY=sk-123

# Additional apt packages
cco --packages terraform,kubectl

# Enable Docker access
cco --docker

# Update cco installation
cco self-update

# Clean up containers
cco cleanup
```

## Command Pass-through

`cco` acts as a wrapper - any options it doesn't recognize get passed directly to Claude Code:

```bash
# These Claude Code options work normally
cco --resume
cco --model claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 "write tests"
cco --no-clipboard "analyze this file"

# Mix cco and Claude options
cco --env DEBUG=1 --resume  # `cco` + Claude options
```

## MCP Server Support

`cco` uses host-based networking so that MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers or other tools you may have running on localhost are accessible to `cco`.

- **OrbStack**: Native host networking support - MCP servers on localhost work automatically
- **Docker Desktop 4.34+**: Host networking available - enable in Settings → Resources → Network
- **Older Docker**: Uses `host.docker.internal` bridge - may require MCP server reconfiguration

If you're using MCP servers with localhost addresses and they're not accessible, consider:
1. Upgrading to Docker Desktop 4.34+ or switching to OrbStack
2. Reconfiguring MCP servers to use `host.docker.internal` instead of `localhost`

### Stdio-based MCP Servers

**Important**: Stdio-based MCP servers need to be installed inside the container. `cco` cannot access stdio-based MCP servers that you have installed on your Mac/host system.

This is because stdio MCP servers run as separate processes that Claude Code launches directly, and the container can only see programs installed within it.

**If installable via apt:**
```bash
cco --packages your-mcp-server-package "help me code"
```

**For custom installation, modify the Dockerfile:**
```bash
# Clone or fork the cco repository
git clone https://github.com/sfdan/cco.git
cd cco

# Edit the Dockerfile to add your MCP server installations
# Add lines like these before the final ENTRYPOINT/CMD:
# RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y your-mcp-server
# RUN pip install your-python-mcp-server  
# RUN npm install -g your-nodejs-mcp-server

# Build your custom image
./cco --rebuild "help me with MCP server functionality"
```

## Configuration

### Environment setup
`cco` passes through everything you need:
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Direct access
- Terminal settings (`TERM`, `NO_COLOR`)
- Git configuration
- Locale and timezone
- Claude Code background tasks enabled by default (use `--disable-background-tasks` to turn off)

### Project-level config
```bash
# Use .env files
echo "DEBUG=1" > .env
cco
```

## Requirements

- **Sandbox backend**: ONE of the following:
  - **macOS**: sandbox-exec (built-in) OR Docker
  - **Linux**: bubblewrap (bwrap) OR Docker
- **Claude Code**: Must be authenticated (run `claude` and login)
- **Bash**: For the wrapper

### Authentication
`cco` automatically finds your Claude credentials:
- **Native sandbox mode**:
  - **macOS**: Direct Keychain access via sandbox-exec
  - **Linux**: Direct file access via bubblewrap
- **Docker sandbox mode**:
  - **macOS**: Extracts from Keychain and mounts securely
  - **Linux**: Mounts `~/.claude/.credentials.json` or config directory
- **Environment**: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` passed through in both modes

## Architecture

### Sandbox modes

#### Native sandboxing (default when available)
- **macOS**: Uses sandbox-exec (Seatbelt) for OS-level isolation
- **Linux**: Uses bubblewrap for lightweight containerization
- **Benefits**: Fast startup, no Docker overhead, direct system integration

#### Docker sandboxing (fallback)
- **Container specs**:
  - Node.js 20 with development tools
  - Modern CLI utilities (jq, ripgrep, fzf)
  - Multiple language support
  - Database clients and network tools

### Safety features
- Isolated environment
- Secure credential mounting
- Proper permission mapping
- Fresh session every time

## Examples

### Development workflow
```bash
cd my-project
cco
cco "add tests to the auth module"
cco --resume
```

### CI/CD usage
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-key
cco "review this pull request"
```

## Experimental Features

⚠️ **These features are experimental and may have edge cases. Use with caution.**

```bash
# OAuth token refresh (EXPERIMENTAL)
# Allows Claude to refresh expired tokens and sync back to host system
cco --allow-oauth-refresh "help me code"

# Credential management (EXPERIMENTAL)  
# Backup and restore Claude Code credentials for safety
cco backup-creds                    # Backup current credentials
cco restore-creds                   # Restore from most recent backup
cco restore-creds backup-file.json  # Restore from specific backup
```

**OAuth refresh feature**: Enables bidirectional credential sync when Claude refreshes expired tokens. Uses race condition protection and creates automatic backups.

**Credential management**: Provides manual backup/restore of Claude Code credentials with cross-platform support (macOS Keychain + Linux files).

## Troubleshooting

**Authentication issues**
- Run `claude` first to authenticate
- Check Claude works outside `cco`

**Token expiration**
- If you get authentication errors, your OAuth token may have expired
- The containerized environment prevents automatic token refresh by default
- **Solution**: Run `claude` directly (outside `cco`) to re-authenticate, then retry with `cco`
- For automatic token refresh, try the experimental `--allow-oauth-refresh` flag (use with caution)

**Docker problems**
- Start Docker daemon
- Verify with `docker info`

**Permission errors**
- `cco` handles user mapping automatically
- Try `cco --rebuild` if needed

**Experimental features not working**
- OAuth refresh (`--allow-oauth-refresh`) is experimental and may have issues
- Fallback: authenticate directly with `claude` when tokens expire
- Use credential backup/restore commands for safety: `cco backup-creds` / `cco restore-creds`

### Known Issues

**Token expires during active session (macOS)**
If Claude stops responding with API errors during an active `cco` session, your OAuth token has likely expired mid-session. This is primarily a macOS issue due to credential storage differences.

**Root cause**: When Claude Code runs inside the Linux container, it cannot directly update the macOS Keychain on the host system where credentials are stored. The OAuth refresh call is "coming from inside the house" but can't reach the host Keychain.

**Workaround**:
1. Open a new terminal window
2. Run `claude` (outside `cco`) 
3. Run `/login` to re-authenticate
4. Exit the raw claude session
5. Quit your current `cco` session
6. Restart with `cco --resume` to pick up the refreshed credentials

**Linux note**: This issue may not affect Linux systems where credentials are file-based and can potentially be updated with `--allow-oauth-refresh` flag, though this needs more testing.

*PRs welcome to investigate cross-platform solutions for seamless credential refresh.*

**Stdio-based MCP servers not available**
If Claude reports that stdio-based MCP servers are not found or not working, they need to be installed inside the container. See [MCP Server Support](#mcp-server-support) section for installation instructions.

### Debug access
```bash
cco shell  # Get inside for inspection
cco --info  # Check system status
```

## Security

`cco` provides protection primarily through filesystem isolation and credential management. **Important limitations to understand:**

### What `cco` protects against:
- Uncontrolled file system access outside your project
- Credential exposure and improper credential handling
- System-level changes that persist after sessions

### What `cco` does NOT protect against:
- **Network security**: Claude has full access to your network and localhost services
- **Data exfiltration**: Claude can still make web requests and access network resources
- **Local service access**: Claude can connect to databases, APIs, and other services on your system

**Network access is intentionally unrestricted** to support MCP servers and maintain Claude's full functionality. The primary security benefits come from filesystem and credential isolation, not network isolation.

**For detailed security information, threat model, and limitations, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).**

**Practice safe computing.**
